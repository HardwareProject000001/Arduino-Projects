Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. The Arduino boards are able to read inputs, such as light on a sensor or a finger on a button, and turn them into outputs, such as activating a motor or turning on an LED. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so, you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

- **Loop Function**: `void loop() { /* code here */ }` - Runs continuously after the setup function.

### Example Sketch

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);  // Initialize the built-in LED pin as an output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // Wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // Turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // Wait for a second
}
```
