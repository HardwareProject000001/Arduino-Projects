Arduino is an open-source electronics platform based on easy-to-use hardware and software. It's intended for anyone making interactive projects. The Arduino boards are able to read inputs, such as light on a sensor or a finger on a button, and turn them into outputs, such as activating a motor or turning on an LED. You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so, you use the Arduino programming language (based on Wiring), and the Arduino Software (IDE), based on Processing.

<h3>Arduino Leonardo</h3>
<p>
<img width="471" alt="Screenshot 2024-06-05 at 8 57 30 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dddecb99-d927-4436-aeff-b00ecf9f20f2">
</p>
<p>The Arduino Leonardo differs from other Arduino boards by using the ATmega32u4 microcontroller with built-in USB communication, eliminating the need for a separate USB-to-serial adapter. This allows the Leonardo to appear as a mouse and keyboard to connected computers, in addition to a virtual (CDC) serial/COM port. It has 20 digital I/O pins, 7 analog inputs, and a micro-USB connection. This unique capability makes it ideal for projects that involve human interface devices like keyboards, mice, and game controllers. The Leonardo can be powered via the USB connection or an external power supply.</p>

- **Loop Function**: `void loop() { /* code here */ }` - Runs continuously after the setup function.

### Example Sketch

```cpp
void setup() {
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);  // Initialize the built-in LED pin as an output
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);  // Turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level)
  delay(1000);                      // Wait for a second
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);   // Turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW
  delay(1000);                      // Wait for a second
}
```
